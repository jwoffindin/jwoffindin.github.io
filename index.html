          <ul>
            <li>Authoring several <strong>organisation-wide policies</strong> covering most aspects of the SDLC. These help ensure NTU and vendor software development and deployment practices comply with government security requirements.</li>
            <li>Introduced <strong>light-weight, effective, change management policies</strong> to manage change risk, bypassing the need for external approval processes (i.e. CAB).</li>
            <li><strong>Improved accuracy and delivery times</strong> for on-call support, while reducing overall effort spent by the team.</li>
            <li>Built standard Azure DevOps libraries for Terraform IaC pipelines.</li>
            <li>Wrote <strong>Terraform-based solutions</strong> to:
              <ul>
                <li>Manage Azure DevOps Projects, Repositories, pipelines and secrets for all NTU software development</li>

            This was largely achieved through advocating and
            implementation of modern infrastructure and software delivery practices. I focusing on key pillars of standardisation, automation, monitoring, communication, and process of constant improvement.
          </p>

          <p>Specific outcomes that I achieved during this project include:</p>

          <ul>
            <li><strong>Faster delivery of new environments</strong> for testers and business users - down from <strong>months to hours</strong>.</li>
            <li>More stable environments. <strong>Significantly reduced frequency and duration of outages</strong> impacting testers and other business users.</li>
            <li><strong>Infrastructure costs reduced by 50%.</strong></li>
